# ShadowTombRaiderHelper

This tool is made to help test out speedrun jumps, skips & bugs.

### Current features:
- Save Location (Default K, Rebindable by dropdown menu)
- Load Location (Default L, Rebindable by dropdown menu)
- Noclip on/off (Default N, Rebindable by dropdown menu)
- Move in noclip (W, A, S, D, Space, Left Control, Not rebindable)

### Planned Features:
- All keys rebindable
- Better rebind selection and system
- Change noclip speed with hotkey (Mousewheel planned as potential hotkey for it) (and maybe UI too)
- Smoother movement in noclip mode (currently it is rather sluggish and slow in receiving input)

### Potential features:
- Instead of moving Lara in static location in map (x,y,z) Move Lara towards current camera angle
- Saving & loading camera rotation too along with Lara's position
- Fix for noclip & save/load not forcing the position but rather attempting to move to correct position
- Cutscene skip cheat?
